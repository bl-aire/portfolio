                        through
                        its course that ran for three months. On rounding up, I could work comfortably with HTML,
                        CSS
                        and JavaScript.

                        <b>Google Africa Developer Scholarship(GADS)</b>: GADS is a six month long program organized
                        by Google,

                        <li>
                            Proposed solutions to accessibility issues pointed out by tests and discussed these
                            solutions with members of JupyterHub’s community and the JupyterLab accessibility team.
